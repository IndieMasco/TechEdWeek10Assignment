# Python for beginners

## About This Project



## Reflection
Gabby - For this week's project, we were tasked with conducting a research project. We chose to focus on a programming language - Python. While we only explored the basics, I feel we gained a solid understanding of how Python works. With my existing coding background, I can see why it's considered beginner friendly. Working with Sam was a great experience. We shared ideas, made decisions together, and communicated well throughout. When we hit a blocker, we adapted quickly and found a way to move forward. This was our first group project, and overall, I think we worked really well as a team. 

## What We Learned
Gabby - This assignment taught me that things don't always go according to plan. When I couldn't get the code running on my local computer after cloning the GitHub repository, we tried different solutions. When those didn't work, we adapted and found an alternative. That experience showed me the importance of teamwork and flexibility. Figuring things out together reinforced how valuable collaboration is. WHen something doesn't work the first time, it's all about adjusting the plan and finding a better approach. 


## Blockers
One of the biggest blockers we encountered was getting the project to run on Gabby's computer after cloning the GitHub repository. Despite following the setup instructions and consulting YouTube tutorials, she kept running into errors when trying to install required packages locally. We looked through documentation and tried various solutions, but nothing worked. As a result, our progress was stalled for the day. 

To keep things moving, we decided to switch to pair programming - working together on Sam's computer instead. This workaround allowed us to continue coding collaboratively, and it ended up being a really effective solution for the rest of the project.
