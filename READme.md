# Python for beginners

## About This Project
This project is a beginners guide to Python, so anyone with a basic understanding of coding will be able to look at this and start their journey with Python. We have created set-up guides for both Windows and MacOS, and provided external resources that helped us along the way. 

## Reflection
Gabby - For this week's project, we were tasked with conducting a research project. We chose to focus on a programming language - Python. While we only explored the basics, I feel we gained a solid understanding of how Python works. With my existing coding background, I can see why it's considered beginner friendly. Working with Sam was a great experience. We shared ideas, made decisions together, and communicated well throughout. When we hit a blocker, we adapted quickly and found a way to move forward. This was our first group project together, and overall, I think we worked really well as a team. 

Sam - This was a group assignment where we had to do research on something we hadn't learned while on this course and present it to the class so they could use it. We came to the decision to pick Python as it's something we have both seen a lot in job ads along with other languages. We wanted to keep it simple and beginner-friendly so anyone who looked at our documentation could understand the basics of Python and also know the slight differences between Python and JavaScript. Overall, I feel like this assignment went really well. Gabby and I worked really well together, and we both walked away from this assignment with improved skills in working in a group.

## What We Learned
Gabby - This assignment taught me that things don't always go according to plan. When I couldn't get the code running on my local computer after cloning the GitHub repository, we tried different solutions. When those didn't work, we adapted and found an alternative. That experience showed me the importance of teamwork and flexibility. Figuring things out together reinforced how valuable collaboration is. When something doesn't work the first time, it's all about adjusting the plan and finding a better approach. 

Sam - I feel like I've learnt a lot this week. I now have a good understanding of Python basics and know the key differences between Python and JavaScript, build upon my team skills, paired programming, and improve my communication skills.

## Blockers
One of the biggest blockers we encountered was getting the project to run on Gabby's computer after cloning the GitHub repository. Despite following the setup instructions and consulting YouTube tutorials, she kept running into errors when trying to install required packages locally. We looked through documentation and tried various solutions, but nothing worked. As a result, our progress was stalled for the day. 

To keep things moving, we decided to switch to pair programming - working together on Sam's computer instead. This workaround allowed us to continue coding collaboratively, and it ended up being a really effective solution for the rest of the project.
